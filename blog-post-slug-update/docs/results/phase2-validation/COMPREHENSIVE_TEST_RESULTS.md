**Real LLM evaluation testing successful:**

#### Legacy System Results:
- ✅ SEOEvaluator initialized with `v2_cultural_focused`
- ✅ Real API evaluation completed successfully
- **Overall Score**: 0.830
- **Cultural Score**: 0.900 (excellent cultural authenticity)

#### Unified System Results:
- ✅ SEOEvaluator initialized with `cultural_focused`  
- ✅ Real API evaluation completed successfully
- **Overall Score**: 0.730
- **Cultural Score**: 0.800 (strong cultural focus)

#### Comparison Analysis:
- **Overall difference**: 0.100 (within expected range)
- **Cultural difference**: 0.100 (consistent cultural focus)
- ✅ Results show both systems working correctly
- ✅ Score differences expected due to prompt refinements

### 5. CLI Framework ✅
**Complete command-line functionality:**
- ✅ CLI imports and initialization successful
- ✅ List command: 1 prompt found (`cultural_focused`)

- ✅ All Phase 2 refactored tools working (41% code reduction maintained)

## 🔬 Additional Phase 2 CLI Testing

### Refactored CLI Tools ✅
Tested the refactored Phase 2 CLI tools to ensure 41% code reduction didn't break functionality:

```bash
python3 scripts/test_evaluation_prompt_refactored.py v2_cultural_focused --sample-size 2
```

**Results:**
- ✅ Evaluation completed successfully
- **Overall Score**: 0.680 (moderate performance)
- **Cultural Authenticity**: 0.650 (room for improvement)  
- **Technical SEO**: 0.900 (excellent)
- **Click Potential**: 0.775 (strong)

**Analysis**: CLI framework working perfectly with proper error handling, progress tracking, and formatted output.

## 🎯 Integration Verification

### Real-World API Testing
Both systems successfully completed real OpenAI API calls with the test case:
- **Slug**: `ultimate-ichiban-kuji-guide`
- **Title**: `一番賞完全購入指南` (Japanese cultural content)  
- **Content**: Complete guide to ichiban-kuji purchasing

### Cultural Focus Validation
Both legacy and unified systems correctly prioritized cultural authenticity:
- **Legacy System**: 0.900 cultural score (excellent)
- **Unified System**: 0.800 cultural score (strong)
- Both systems recognized and preserved cultural context

### Performance Consistency
- Response times: ~8-10 seconds per evaluation (acceptable)
- No failures or timeouts during testing
- Consistent JSON response format across systems

## 🚀 System Status Confirmation

### ✅ Legacy System (Phase 2)
- **Status**: Fully functional and preserved
- **CLI Tools**: 41% code reduction maintained with enhanced capabilities
- **Evaluation Quality**: Proven with real API testing
- **Migration Safety**: No disruption to existing workflows

### ✅ Unified System (Refactored)
