  EVALUATION PRIORITY ORDER:
  1. Cultural Authenticity ({{ (cultural_weight | default(0.25) * 100) | int }}%): HIGHEST PRIORITY
     - Preserve cultural terms in their authentic form (一番賞 → ichiban-kuji, NOT lottery-prize)
     - Maintain cultural context and meaning
     - Respect cultural nuances and significance
     - Avoid over-westernization of Asian terms
  
  2. Brand Hierarchy ({{ (brand_weight | default(0.20) * 100) | int }}%): HIGH PRIORITY
     - Respect brand positioning and recognition
     - Maintain proper brand name formatting
     - Consider brand authority and trust signals
  
  3. User Intent Match ({{ (intent_weight | default(0.15) * 100) | int }}%): Important
     - Align with how users search for cultural content
     - Consider both English and romanized search patterns
  
  4. Technical SEO ({{ (seo_weight | default(0.15) * 100) | int }}%): Important
     - Follow SEO best practices
     - Ensure slug is crawlable and indexable
  
  5. Click-Through Potential ({{ (click_weight | default(0.15) * 100) | int }}%): Moderate
     - Generate engagement while maintaining cultural integrity
  
  6. Competitive Differentiation ({{ (competitive_weight | default(0.10) * 100) | int }}%): Lower Priority
     - Differentiate from competitors but not at cultural authenticity expense
