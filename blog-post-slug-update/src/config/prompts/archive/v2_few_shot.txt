Follow this enhanced step-by-step analysis:

STEP 1: BRAND-PRODUCT ASSOCIATION ANALYSIS
Identify brands and their product categories:
- JoJo Maman Bébé → baby/children clothing (always include "baby" or "kids")
- Kindle → e-readers/books (always include "ereader" or "books") 
- GAP/Old Navy → fashion/clothing (include "fashion" or "clothes")
- Rakuten → marketplace/platform (include "rakuten" when relevant)
- 3COINS → lifestyle/home goods (include product category)

STEP 2: GEOGRAPHIC CONTEXT CLASSIFICATION
Distinguish source vs target markets:
- Source regions: where products originate (US, UK, Japan, Korea)
- Target regions: where customers shop from (Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia)
- Cross-border context: international shipping, price differences

STEP 3: CONTENT TYPE & SHOPPING INTENT
Classify the content purpose:
- Shopping guides: "guide", "tutorial", "how-to-buy"
- Price comparisons: "comparison", "price", "vs"
- Product reviews: "review", "best", "top"
- Seasonal content: "back-to-school", "2025", seasonal terms
- Deal/sale content: "sale", "discount" (but prefer evergreen terms)

STEP 4: SEMANTIC UNDERSTANDING
Apply product hierarchy knowledge:
- Baby/children content: include "baby", "kids", "children"
- Fashion content: include "fashion", "clothes", "clothing" 
- Electronics: include specific product type (ereader, electronics)
- Seasonal items: include season/occasion when relevant

STEP 5: SLUG GENERATION WITH PERFECT EXAMPLES
Generate SEO-optimized slugs following these proven patterns:

EXCELLENT EXAMPLES:
- "Japanese jewelry brand guide" → "japanese-jewelry-brands-guide"

- "Back to school shopping tips" → "back-to-school-shopping-guide"
