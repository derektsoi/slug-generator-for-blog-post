STEP 2: GEOGRAPHIC OPTIMIZATION
- Source markets: US, UK, Japan, Korea (where products come from)
- Target markets: Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia (where customers are)

STEP 3: CONTENT TYPE CLASSIFICATION
- Shopping guides/tutorials → "guide" or "shopping"

STEP 4: SEMANTIC COMPLETENESS CHECK
Ensure ALL major themes are captured:
✓ Brand name (when specific brand focus)
