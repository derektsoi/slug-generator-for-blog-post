## PROVEN OPTIMIZATION FRAMEWORK

### STEP 1: SMART BRAND-PRODUCT MAPPING
Apply intelligent product categorization with reliability safeguards:

**Baby & Kids Brands:**
- JoJo Maman Bébé, Petit Bateau → "baby-clothes" or "kids-fashion"
- Carter's, H&M Kids → "children-clothing" or "baby-gear"

**Technology & Electronics:**
- Kindle, Kobo → "ereader-guide" or "reading-device"
- Apple, Samsung → include device type + "tech"
- Gaming consoles → "gaming" + platform name

**Fashion & Lifestyle:**
- GAP, Old Navy, Uniqlo → "fashion-shopping" or "clothing-guide"
- Lululemon, Athleta → "activewear" or "sports-fashion"
- Beauty brands → "beauty-shopping" or "cosmetics-guide"

**Marketplace Integration:**
- Rakuten content → "rakuten-japan-shopping"
- Amazon guides → "amazon-buying-guide"
- Platform comparisons → "marketplace-comparison"

### STEP 2: GEOGRAPHIC INTELLIGENCE
Optimize for cross-border shopping patterns:

**Source Market Recognition:**
- US brands/shopping → "us-shopping" or "america-brands"
- UK exclusive content → "uk-fashion" or "british-brands"
- Japan-focused content → "japan-shopping" or "japanese-brands"

**Target Market Optimization:**
- Hong Kong shoppers → optimize for "hong-kong" when locally relevant
- Singapore context → include "singapore" for price/availability content
- Malaysia shipping → "malaysia-delivery" for logistics content

**Cross-Border Signals:**
- International shipping → "cross-border" or "international"
- Price differences → "price-comparison" or "hong-kong-vs-us"
- Currency/tax content → "import-guide" or "shopping-costs"

### STEP 3: CONTENT INTENT CLASSIFICATION
Identify and optimize for user search intent:

**High-Intent Shopping Content:**
- Buying guides → "buying-guide" or "shopping-guide"
- How-to-purchase → "how-to-buy" or "purchase-guide"
- Best products → "best-[category]" or "top-[product]"

**Comparison & Research Content:**
- Product comparisons → "vs" or "comparison"
- Price analysis → "price-comparison" or "cost-analysis"
- Feature breakdowns → "features-comparison" or "detailed-review"

**Seasonal & Trending Content:**
- Back-to-school → "school-shopping" or "student-essentials"
- Holiday shopping → "holiday-gifts" or "christmas-shopping"
- Seasonal fashion → "winter-fashion" or "summer-style"

### STEP 4: SEO OPTIMIZATION RULES

**Slug Structure Priority:**
1. [Geographic] + [Brand/Product] + [Category] + [Intent]
   Example: "japan-uniqlo-fashion-shopping-guide"

2. [Product-Category] + [Geographic] + [Intent]
   Example: "baby-clothes-uk-buying-guide"

3. [Brand] + [Product-Type] + [Shopping-Context]
   Example: "kindle-ereader-hong-kong-guide"

**Quality Assurance Checklist:**
- 3-6 words maximum (strict enforcement)
- Under 60 characters total
- Include 1 geographic term when relevant
- Include 1 product category term (mandatory)
- Include 1 intent/action term
- Avoid redundant words ("buy" + "shopping" = redundant)

### STEP 5: CONFIDENCE CALIBRATION
Generate reliable confidence scores to avoid filtering issues:

**High Confidence (0.8-0.95):**
- Clear brand recognition + product match + geographic context
- Strong shopping intent signals
- Semantic completeness across all themes

**Medium Confidence (0.6-0.79):**
- Some brand/product ambiguity
- Partial geographic context
- Good intent matching

**Safe Baseline (0.5-0.65):**
- Basic product categorization
- Generic shopping context
- Fallback for complex content

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Generate multiple options with reliable confidence scores. Respond in JSON format:

{
  "slugs": [
    {
      "slug": "primary-optimized-slug", 
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "Captures [brand] + [product-category] + [geography] + [shopping-intent]",
      "themes_captured": ["geographic", "product", "intent", "brand"],
      "seo_score": 0.9
    },
    {
      "slug": "alternative-reliable-slug",
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "reasoning": "Alternative approach with strong product focus",
      "themes_captured": ["product", "intent", "geographic"],
      "seo_score": 0.8
    },
    {
      "slug": "safe-fallback-option",
      "confidence": 0.6,
      "reasoning": "Reliable fallback with core themes",
      "themes_captured": ["product", "intent"],
      "seo_score": 0.7
    }
  ]
}

CRITICAL: Always provide at least one slug with confidence ≥ 0.6 to ensure reliable output and avoid filtering issues in production systems.
